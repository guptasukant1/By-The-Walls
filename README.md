# Repo for my wallpaper project

## Add Upload option along with option for categories
## Search option per category
## Explicit content blocker
## Allow limit uploads daily
## Add automatic categorizer
## Check whether converting to react project is needed or not
## Add Shepherd.js to help on-board the user (tour of the site)



## Find a way to host files rather than storing in repo itself. MongoDB uploads can be considered, but find ORM solution for this
