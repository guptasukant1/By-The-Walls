# Repo for my wallpaper project

### Add Upload option along with option for categories
### Dedicated Download option
### Search option per category
### Explicit content blocker
### Allow a description section under image. 
### Limited uploads daily
### Add automatic sorter
### Add a tool to search on the basis of the dominant colour of the wallpaper
### Check whether converting to react project is needed or not
### Add Shepherd.js to help on-board the user (tour of the site)



### Find a way to host files rather than storing in repo itself. MongoDB uploads can be considered, but find ORM/ORD solution for this
